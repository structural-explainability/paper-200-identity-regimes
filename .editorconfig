# REQ.UNIVERSAL: All professional GitHub project repositories MUST include .editorconfig.
# WHY: Establish a cross-editor baseline (VS Code, PyCharm, Vim, etc.) so diffs stay clean and formatting is consistent.
# ALT: Repository may omit .editorconfig ONLY if formatting is enforced equivalently by CI + formatter tooling for all contributors or solo projects.
# CUSTOM: Adjust indent_size defaults only if organizational standards change; keep stable across projects.
