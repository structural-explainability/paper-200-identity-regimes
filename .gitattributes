# REQ.UNIVERSAL: All professional GitHub project repositories MUST include .gitattributes.
# WHY: Ensure consistent line endings, diff behavior, and repository metadata
#      across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
# ALT: Repository may omit .gitattributes ONLY if equivalent normalization is
#      enforced by tooling and CI (rare and fragile).
# CUSTOM: Update file-type rules only when introducing new languages or artifact types.

# WHY: Auto-detect text files and normalize line endings to avoid cross-platform drift.
* text=auto


# === Source Code ===

# WHY: Python and shell scripts must use LF for CI/CD, Linux environments, and containers.
*.py    text eol=lf
*.sh    text eol=lf

# WHY: PowerShell convention on Windows uses CRLF.
*.ps1   text eol=crlf


# === Markup and Documentation ===

# WHY: Documentation and markup files use LF; standard for cross-platform tooling.
*.bib   text eol=lf
*.cls   text eol=lf
*.md    text eol=lf
*.sty   text eol=lf
*.tex   text eol=lf


# === Configuration and Data (Text) ===

# WHY: Configuration and structured text formats use LF for stable diffs.
*.json     text eol=lf
*.jsonc   text eol=lf
*.jsonl   text eol=lf
*.ndjson  text eol=lf
*.toml    text eol=lf
*.yaml    text eol=lf
*.yml     text eol=lf


# === GitHub Metadata ===

# WHY: Exclude documentation and tests from GitHub language statistics.
docs/**   linguist-documentation
tests/**  linguist-documentation


# === Notebooks ===

# WHY: Jupyter notebooks require specialized diff and merge handling.
*.ipynb   diff=jupyternotebook
*.ipynb   merge=jupyternotebook


# === Databases (Binary) ===

# WHY: Database files are binary; prevent text normalization and meaningless diffs.
*.db       binary
*.duckdb   binary
*.sqlite   binary
*.sqlite3  binary

# === Columnar / Analytical Data (Binary) ===

# WHY: Columnar and analytical data formats are binary; diffs are not meaningful.
*.arrow    binary
*.avro     binary
*.feather  binary
*.orc      binary
*.parquet  binary


# === Office, BI, PDFs, and Compressed Artifacts (Binary) ===

# WHY: Office documents, BI files, PDFs, and compressed artifacts are binary.
*.7z     binary
*.bz2    binary
*.docx   binary
*.gz     binary
*.pbix   binary
*.pbit   binary
*.pdf    binary
*.pptx   binary
*.rar    binary
*.tar    binary
