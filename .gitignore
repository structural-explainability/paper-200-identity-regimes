# REQ.UNIVERSAL: All professional GitHub project repositories MUST include .gitignore.
# WHY: Prevent committing generated artifacts, local state, secrets, and OS-specific files.
# ALT: Repository may customize ignores, but MUST preserve universal safety rules.
# CUSTOM: Add repo-specific patterns in the dedicated section at the bottom.

# === Universal (all projects, all languages) ===

# WHY: Logs can be useful during local debugging but are machine-local artifacts.
# ALT: Remove this ignore temporarily if logs must be inspected.
*.log
logs/

# WHY: Temporary, backup, and swap files are machine-local noise.
*.swo
*.swp
*.tmp
*~
*.bak
*.backup

# WHY: Generic caches are machine-local and should not be tracked.
.cache/

# WHY: OS-generated metadata files should never be tracked.

# WHY: IDE/editor metadata is machine-local and should not be tracked.
.idea/
*.code-workspace
.history/

# === VS Code (special case) ===

# WHY: Ignore editor state while allowing a shared baseline configuration.
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
# ALT: Commit .vscode/settings.json only if essential and not user-specific.
# !.vscode/settings.json
# ALT: Commit .vscode/tasks.json only if tasks are essential and not user-specific.
# !.vscode/tasks.json

# === Environment variables and secrets ===

# WHY: Never commit credentials or environment-specific configuration.
.env
.env.*
*.env

# === Documentation / site build output ===

# WHY: Static site build output is generated.

# === LaTeX papers ===

# WHY: LaTeX build artifacts - regenerated on each compile

# WHY: Build directory and intermediate PDFs

# WHY: Reference PDFs - available elsewhere, not redistributed here
# OBS: Helps locate sources without republishing copyrighted material
# CUSTOM: Update paths if reference locations change
