### Title

```
Substrate Stability Under Persistent Disagreement: \\
Structural Constraints for \\ Neutral Ontological Substrates
```

### Abstract

```
Modern data systems increasingly operate under conditions of persistent legal,
  political, and analytic disagreement.
  In such settings, interoperability cannot rely on shared interpretation,
  negotiated semantics, or centralized authority.
  Instead, representations must function as neutral substrates that preserve
  stable reference across incompatible extensions.

  This paper investigates the structural constraints imposed on ontological
  design by this requirement.
  Building on a neutrality framework that treats interpretive non-commitment and
  stability under extension as explicit design constraints, we ask what minimal
  ontological structure is forced if accountability relationships are to remain
  referable and comparable under disagreement.
  Minimality here is not mere parsimony:
  a reduction is admissible only if it does not
  reintroduce \stabilitycritical{} distinctions
  as hidden roles, flags, or contextual predicates.

  We establish a conditional lower-bound result: any ontology capable of
  supporting accountability under persistent disagreement must realize at least
  six distinct identity-and-persistence regimes.
  We further show that a construction with exactly six such regimes is sufficient
  to satisfy the stated requirements without embedding causal or normative
  commitments in the substrate.
  The result is not a proposal for a universal ontology, but a constraint on what
  is possible when neutrality and stable reference are treated as non-negotiable
  design goals.

\section*{Proof Contract and Direction of Dependence}
\label{sec:proof-contract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Proof Contract and Direction of Dependence}

This paper establishes structural constraints for neutral substrates
optimized for interoperability under persistent disagreement.
All claims are structural, not empirical, causal, normative, or evaluative.


\subsection*{Paper-Level Constraints}


\REQ{GOAL}{All arguments in this paper MUST address stability and admissibility
  of substrate structure under persistent disagreement, and no broader claim.}
\WHY{GOAL}{Restricting the proof target prevents scope creep into ontology design,
  governance, or application-specific modeling.}

\REQ{OPT}{This paper MUST treat interoperability under persistent disagreement
  and stable reference as the sole optimization objective.}
\WHY{OPT}{Alternative objectives (e.g., expressive convenience, local agreement)
  admit different structures and are explicitly out of scope.}

\REQ{COND}{All results MUST be conditional on the stated assumptions.
  The analysis applies only under these assumptions; alternative assumptions
  motivate different results and are outside the present scope.}
\WHY{COND}{This paper establishes constraint results, not universal prescriptions.}

\REQ{PROOF}{All claims MUST follow from explicit definitions, stated assumptions,
  and logical inference.
  No causal, empirical, or normative premises are admitted unless explicitly
  marked as OBS.}
\WHY{PROOF}{Substrate-layer claims must remain valid across incompatible
  interpretive frameworks.
  Hidden commitments undermine extension stability.}


\subsection*{Foundational Assumptions}


\REQ{DISAGREE}{Persistent disagreement MUST be treated as a stable condition,
  not a temporary failure to converge.}
\WHY{DISAGREE}{The substrate is intended for environments where interpretive
  convergence cannot be assumed or enforced.}

\REQ{EXT}{Extensions to the substrate MUST be admissible without coordination.}
\WHY{EXT}{Neutral substrates must support independent extension without revision
  of identity or admissibility conditions.}

\REQ{NEUTRAL}{The substrate MUST be pre-causal and pre-normative.}
\WHY{NEUTRAL}{Causal and normative commitments impose interpretive direction and
  prevent plural extension.}


\subsection*{Stable Reference Requirements}


\REQ{ID}{Identity conditions MUST be fixed prior to explanation or interpretation.}
\WHY{ID}{Explanation presupposes stable referents; without identity,
  comparison and accountability are impossible.}

\REQ{ID-STABLE}{Identity and admissible relations MUST remain invariant across
  incompatible extensions.}
\WHY{ID-STABLE}{If admissibility depends on interpretation, stability is lost
  under disagreement.}

\REQ{NO-HIDDEN}{Stability-critical distinctions MUST NOT be encoded solely as
  roles, flags, contextual predicates, or other internal discriminators.}
\WHY{NO-HIDDEN}{Such encodings rely on shared interpretation and therefore
  do not satisfy the stability constraint under disagreement.}


\subsection*{Minimality Constraint}


\REQ{MIN}{Minimality MUST be understood as minimizing explicit identity-and-
  persistence regimes subject to stability and neutrality constraints.}
\WHY{MIN}{Reductions that reintroduce the same distinctions as hidden structure
  do not reduce total complexity and are excluded by this criterion.}


\subsection*{Direction of Dependence}


\REQ{DEP}{The direction of dependence MUST be:
  \emph{Identity precedes admissibility; admissibility precedes interpretation}.}
\WHY{DEP}{Reversing this order smuggles interpretive commitments into the substrate,
  undermining neutrality and stable reference.}


\subsection*{Explicit Non-Goals}


\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT define an ontology of entities or entity kinds.}
\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT propose a domain model or Evolution Protocol.}
\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT evaluate causes, outcomes, policies, or obligations.}
\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT argue that all ontologies should satisfy these constraints.}


\subsection*{Obligations of Subsequent Sections}


Each subsequent section exists solely to discharge one or more stated REQ items.
Material that does not advance a stated REQ is out of scope.
